# Linear Program Solver
A website that calculates an optimal value (if one exists), given an objective function and different constraints.

The website uses fraction.js, which I did not implement. All credit goes to Robert Eisele and the contributors of the library. You can check out fraction.js here: https://github.com/rawify/Fraction.js
